# Objectives:
Practice recursive functions in both array and linked list

# Overview

1. Go back to complex number in Lab 2 where you store more than 15 complex numbers in an array.
2. Find the largest complex number in the array using recursive method.  The largest number is the one who has the largest (real)*(real) + (img)*(img)
3. Go back to forward link list in Lab 3 where you store many stocks in a link list.
4. Write the reverse print function using recursive method.

# Discussions
1. The textbook has very detail implementation of both routines.  You're encouraged to reference it.
2. In order to easily compare complex numbers, do you think overloading a less than (<) or greater than (>) operator will make code cleaner?  The example used in linked list insertion page has similar operator overloading to facilitate in-order insertion.
3. VIf you want more, do the tower of Hanoi and count the number of recursions ( you can validate your result with wikipedia's number).
