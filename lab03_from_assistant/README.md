Build the forward linked list by following below instruction:

- [x] Student class has string name, int id

s1("Mike", 1000), s2("Bill", 2000), s3("Alex", 3000)

- [x] Node class has pointer next

3. DB class has pointer head, implement functions with
-  [x] insert at front,
-  [x] insert at back,
-  [x] insert at middle,
-  [x] delete at front,
-  [x] delete at back,
-  [x] and think about how to delete middle node.
-  [x] Write your print function to check your linked list.

then make a connection with data, node, and class:  [s1]->[s2]->[s3]->NULL
