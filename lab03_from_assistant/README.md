Build the forward linked list by following below instruction:

- [x] Student class has string name, int id

s1("Mike", 1000), s2("Bill", 2000), s3("Alex", 3000)

- [x] Node class has pointer next

3. DB class has pointer head, implement functions with insert at front, insert at back, insert at middle, delete at front, delete at back, and think about how to delete middle node. Write your print function to check your linked list.

then make a connection with data, node, and class:  [s1]->[s2]->[s3]->NULL
